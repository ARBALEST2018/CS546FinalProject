The result of Obama \u2019s diktat , as contrary to the spirit of the Founders \u2019 Constitution as is the Administrative State , is that law - abiding taxpayers must pay for the kids \u2019 welfare support , health care , and schooling \u2014 as they already do for \u201c anchor babies \u201d born to mothers who have sneaked over the U.S. border for the purpose of having a child eligible for \u201c child - only \u201d welfare benefits , scarcely less than ordinary welfare payments and vastly more than the income of Central American peasant families .

Within 12 hours of the Hillary Clinton - John Podesta - Jamie Dimon meeting at the Chappaqua Compound , this report continues , the BIS registered the transfer of $ 1.8 billion from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank . To why the Clinton Foundation transferred this enormous sum of money to Qatar , this report explains , is due to the longstanding ties between this Islamic neo - patrimonial absolute monarchy and then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who \u201c oversaw / managed \u201d the \u201c massive bribery scheme \u201d that allowed this Gulf State nation to secure the 2022 World Cup \u2014 and that the Qataris were so appreciative of they donated millions to the Clinton Foundation , and incredibly , in 2011 , gave former US President Bill Clinton $ 1 million for a birthday present \u2014 bringing Hillary Clinton \u2019s total \u201c cash grab \u201d from these Persian Gulf sheiks of $ 100 million \u2014 all occurring as recently released secret emails revealed Hillary Clinton \u2019s knowledge that both Qatar and Saudi Arabia were , and still are , funding ISIS . To what Jamie Dimon \u201c related / said to \u201d Hillary Clinton that caused her to suddenly transfer $ 1.8 billion to Qatar , this report notes , revolves around his JP Morgan bank being told by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) in April ( 2016 ) that this \u201c megabanks \u201d master plan to save itself had \u201c serious deficiencies \u201d that could \u201c pose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the United States \u201d . Two months after the FDIC \u2019s warning letter to Jamie Dimon , in June ( 2016 ) , this report says , he cryptically \u201c sounded a warning \u201d that the United States sub - prime auto loan bubble was nearing collapse and stated that \u201c someone is going to get hurt \u201d .\n\n# Task\nExtract the arguments from the document in JSON format:\ngiver : \nrecipient : \nbeneficiary : \n"

The same month that WikiLeaks.org went live , in December of 2006 , Assange posted an essay on his blog , \u201c Conspiracy as Governance , \u201d in which he explained his theory that authoritarian regimes \u2014 and western political parties \u2014 maintain power by conspiring to keep the public in the dark , through \u201c collaborative secrecy , working to the detriment of a population . \u201d In order for the people to regain control of the political system , Assange argued , it is necessary to find ways of \u201c throttling the conspiracy , \u201d like disrupting the ability of the conspirators to communicate secretly . With that in mind , Assange wrote , \u201c let us consider two closely balanced and broadly conspiratorial power groupings , the US Democratic and Republican parties . \u201d He continued , \u201c Consider what would happen if one of these parties gave up their mobile phones , fax and email correspondence \u2014 let alone the computer systems which manage their subscribers , donors , budgets , polling , call centres and direct mail campaigns ? They would immediately fall into an organisational stupor and lose to the other . \u201d A decade later , by releasing thousands of unredacted emails and voice - mail messages hacked from the Democratic Party \u2014 in a database that makes it easy to search for the social security numbers of donors , as well as their passport and credit card details \u2014 Assange was finally able to put his theory into practice , by attempting to throttle one of the \u201c conspiratorial power groupings \u201d that selects candidates to run the U.S. government . Assange \u2019s attack on the DNC certainly revealed hypocrisy within the party , and led to the resignations of four senior officials , but his decision to not redact personal information from those documents \u2014 or from a second cache of emails hacked from a Turkish political party \u2014 also led to criticism from some longtime supporters , including Edward Snowden , the NSA whistleblower .\n## Answer\nparticipant : one of these parties\n\n"

Recently , Justin Trudeau \u2019s new government came under renewed pressure from animal rights activists to ban seal hunting as it has not yet announced a quota for 2016 hunting season that starts by the end of March and continues through April . Canada 's annual commercial seal hunt , which mainly takes place during March and April , sees thousands of young seals clubbed to death for their furs . An estimated 95 - 98 per cent of the seals killed during the commercial hunt are three weeks to three months old , sparking calls for a ban on seal hunting from animal activists . Commercial hunt has shrunk in recent years as major export markets such as the European Union , the United States and Russia have banned import of seal - fur products over animal - welfare concerns .\n\n# Task\nExtract the arguments from the document in JSON format:\ncommunicator : \nplace : \n"

Story Continued Below While Clinton is clear that she never had any intention to mishandle classified documents , a fact that FBI Director James Comey noted as a factor in his decision not to recommend any charges against the former secretary of state , answers she gave to FBI agents during a July 2 interview are likely to reinforce the Republican campaign talking point that she lied to cover up her own recklessness with government secrets . Comey declared in his early July press conference that Clinton had been \u201c extremely careless \u201d in her handling of government secrets during her tenure as secretary of state , a description laid out more thoroughly in the FBI \u2019s release . The newly - released documents do not include transcripts of Clinton \u2019s interview but are instead summaries of the bureau \u2019s investigation and meeting with the former secretary of state , essentially the long - form justification for Comey \u2019s recommendation against pressing charges .\n## Answer\nparticipant : Clinton\nparticipant : FBI agents\n\n"

The same month that WikiLeaks.org went live , in December of 2006 , Assange posted an essay on his blog , \u201c Conspiracy as Governance , \u201d in which he explained his theory that authoritarian regimes \u2014 and western political parties \u2014 maintain power by conspiring to keep the public in the dark , through \u201c collaborative secrecy , working to the detriment of a population . \u201d In order for the people to regain control of the political system , Assange argued , it is necessary to find ways of \u201c throttling the conspiracy , \u201d like disrupting the ability of the conspirators to communicate secretly . With that in mind , Assange wrote , \u201c let us consider two closely balanced and broadly conspiratorial power groupings , the US Democratic and Republican parties . \u201d He continued , \u201c Consider what would happen if one of these parties gave up their mobile phones , fax and email correspondence \u2014 let alone the computer systems which manage their subscribers , donors , budgets , polling , call centres and direct mail campaigns ? They would immediately fall into an organisational stupor and lose to the other . \u201d A decade later , by releasing thousands of unredacted emails and voice - mail messages hacked from the Democratic Party \u2014 in a database that makes it easy to search for the social security numbers of donors , as well as their passport and credit card details \u2014 Assange was finally able to put his theory into practice , by attempting to throttle one of the \u201c conspiratorial power groupings \u201d that selects candidates to run the U.S. government . Assange \u2019s attack on the DNC certainly revealed hypocrisy within the party , and led to the resignations of four senior officials , but his decision to not redact personal information from those documents \u2014 or from a second cache of emails hacked from a Turkish political party \u2014 also led to criticism from some longtime supporters , including Edward Snowden , the NSA whistleblower .\n## Answer\nparticipant : one of these parties\n\n"

And it signed a contract reportedly worth $ 3.5 million with Bill Clinton to serve as an adviser ( though the former president ultimately kept only $ 100,000 of that , according to his tax returns and a source familiar with the arrangement ) .\n\n# Task\nExtract the arguments from the document in JSON format:\ngiver : \nbeneficiary : \nartifact : \n"

In the media , we have shrieking heads with very few people saying anything intelligible .
